  - name: David Weir
    picture: /images/team/davidw-small.jpg
    interests: I co-direct the Laboratory. My research interests include mildly context-sensitive grammar formalisms, syntactic parsing and lexical semantics.
  - name: Jeremy Reffin
    picture: /images/team/jeremy-small.jpeg
    interests: I co-direct the Laboratory. My current research interests are in applying NLP technology to solving real-world problems and in developing the APT model of language.
  - name: Simon Wibberley
    picture: /images/team/simon-small.png
    interest: My primary research area is applied computational social science - I'm mainly interested in how analysts and researchers can be empowered by computational approaches. I also am the lead technical architect behind Method52.
  - name: Andy Robertson
    picture: /images/team/andy-small.png
    interests: My research interests include the application of dependency relations and other structural features to active learning, and methods of automated feature discovery.
  - name: Miroslav Batchkarov
    picture: /images/team/miro-small.png
    interests: My research focuses on distributional models of semantics. I am also involved in several projects that apply NLP methods to commercial problems.
  - name: Jack Pay
    picture: /images/team/jack-small.jpg
    interests: I am a PhD student focusing on pre-processing techniques for use in topic modelling. I am also a member of the Sussex Humanities Laboratory, involved in developing technology for large scale data capture and analysis.
  - name: Matti Lyra
    picture: /images/team/matti-small.jpg
    interests: I am interested in using NLP techniques to solve business problems and drive product development. My research efforts mainly focus on supervised and unsupervised methods for text classification and ensemble methods.
  - name: Joe Taylor

  - name: Justin Crow
    picture: /images/team/justin-small.jpg
  - name: Thomas Kober
    picture: /images/team/thomask-small.jpg
    interests: My primary research interest is compositional distributional semantics. I am furthermore interested in neural network approaches for natural language problems, as well as in active learning, semi-supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
  - name: Roland Davis
    picture: /images/team/roland-small.jpg
    interests: Distributional semantics, language modelling and measurement of plausibility.
  - name: David Spence
    picture: /images/team/davidsp-small.jpg
  - name: Julie Weeds
    picture: /images/team/julie-small.jpg
    interests: My main research interest is lexical semantics.  In particular, I am interested in compositional distributional semantics and linguistic variation.  I am also a member of the Sussex Humanities Lab, with an interest in applying natural language processing techniques to problems in humanities.
