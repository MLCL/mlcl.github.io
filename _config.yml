  - name: Colin Ashby
    picture: /images/team/colin-small.jpg
    interests: I am a PhD student focussing on Web Information Extraction and the design of downstream applications.
  - name: Dave Banks
    picture: /images/team/dave-small.jpg
    interests: I primarily work with the Sussex Humanities Lab; my research interests include internet history and culture, UX and visualization on the web, linguistics and social science.
  - name: Lorenzo Bertolini
    picture: /images/team/lorenzo-small.jpg
    interests: My primary research area is compositional distributional semantics. Furthermore, I am interested in the interaction between composition and entailment.
  - name: Alex Butterworth
    picture: /images/team/alex-small.jpg
  - name: Nestor Prieto-Chavana
    picture: /images/team/nestor-small.jpg
    interests: My primary research interest is the application of Natural Language Processing techniques for Automated Claim Identification and Fact Checking.
  - name: Justin Crow
    picture: /images/team/justin-small.jpg
    interests: I'm a PhD student and lecturer at the university. My primary research interest is in the use of social media for situational awareness, particularly automatic event detection and identification of eyewitnesses. Currently focussed on the improvement of methodologies for rapdily collecting high quality datasets in the immediate aftermath of local events.
  - name: Chris Inskip
    picture: /images/team/chris-small.jpg
    interests: My current research focusses on the application of machine learning techniques to infer latent user demographic attributes on social media.
  - name: Justina Li
    picture: /images/team/justina-small.jpg
    interests: I am a PhD student focusing on Machine Translation. My primary research interest is investigating how different the spaces are for different languages. Potentially, develop a way to transform from one language space to another.
  - name: Mary Adel Mansour
    picture: /images/team/mary-small.jpg
    interests: I am a PhD student and will be working on data analysis of Arabic social media interaction in order to investigate the expression and construction of identities.
  - name: Jack Pay
    picture: /images/team/jack-small.jpg
    interests: I am a PhD student focusing on pre-processing techniques for use in topic modelling. I am also a member of the Sussex Humanities Laboratory, involved in developing technology for large scale data capture and analysis.
  - name: Qiwei Peng
    picture: /images/team/qiwei-small.jpg
    interests: My primary research interest is compositional semantics and its application on tasks like machine translation and summarisation.
  - name: Jeremy Reffin
    picture: /images/team/jeremy-small.jpeg
    interests: I co-direct the Laboratory. My current research interests are in applying NLP technology to solving real-world problems and in developing the APT model of language.
  - name: Shaun Ring
    picture: /images/team/shaun-small.jpg
    interests:  I am a PhD student focussing on document classification. I am investigating the performance of different classification methods across a variety of practical scenarios in order to be able to create a tool that can be tailored to suite a variety of situations.
  - name: Andrew D. Robertson
    picture: /images/team/andy-small.png
    interests: My research areas include methods for automatic key-phrase extraction, automated dynamic querying of social media,  and applying deep learning models to summarisation and classification.
  - name: Julie Weeds
    picture: /images/team/julie-small.jpg
    interests: My main research interest is lexical semantics.  In particular, I am interested in compositional distributional semantics and linguistic variation.  As a former member of the Sussex Humanities Lab and a lecturer on the Data Science MSc, I am also interested in data analysis, computational modelling and applying state-of-the-art NLP techniques to extracting knowledge from unstructured data.
  - name: David Weir
    picture: /images/team/davidw-small.jpg
    interests: I co-direct the Laboratory. My research interests include distributional semantics and computational social science.
  - name: Simon Wibberley
    picture: /images/team/simon-small.png
    interests: My primary research area is applied computational social science - I'm mainly interested in how analysts and researchers can be empowered by computational approaches. I also am the lead technical architect behind Method52.
  - name: Ahmed Younes
    picture: /images/team/ahmed-small.png
    interests: My main research interest is in Arabic NLP. I focus on modeling Arabic language characteristics to exploit them in different tasks.
