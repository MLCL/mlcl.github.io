  - name: David Weir
    picture: /images/team/davidw-small.jpg
    interests: I co-direct the Laboratory. My research interests include mildly context-sensitive grammar formalisms, syntactic parsing and lexical semantics.
  - name: Jeremy Reffin
    picture: /images/team/jeremy-small.jpeg
    interests: I co-direct the Laboratory. My current research interests are in applying NLP technology to solving real-world problems and in developing the APT model of language.
  - name: Simon Wibberley
    picture: /images/team/simon-small.png
    interests: My primary research area is applied computational social science - I'm mainly interested in how analysts and researchers can be empowered by computational approaches. I also am the lead technical architect behind Method52.
  - name: Andy Robertson
    picture: /images/team/andy-small.png
    interests: My research interests include the application of dependency relations and other structural features to active learning, and methods of automated feature discovery.
  - name: Jack Pay
    picture: /images/team/jack-small.jpg
    interests: I am a PhD student focusing on pre-processing techniques for use in topic modelling. I am also a member of the Sussex Humanities Laboratory, involved in developing technology for large scale data capture and analysis.
  - name: Justin Crow

  - name: Julie Weeds
    picture: /images/team/julie-small.jpg
    interests: My main research interest is lexical semantics.  In particular, I am interested in compositional distributional semantics and linguistic variation.  As a former member of the Sussex Humanities Lab and a lecturer on the Data Science MSc, I am also interested in data analysis, computational modelling and applying state-of-the-art NLP techniques to extracting knowledge from unstructured data.
  - name: Chris Inskip
