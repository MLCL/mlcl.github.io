<h3>A Unified Model of Compositional and Distributional Semantics: Theory and Applications</h3>
<p>There have been two main approaches to modelling the meaning of language in NLP. The first, the so-called compositional approach, is based on classical ideas from Philosophy and Mathematical Logic. Using a well-known principle from the 19th century logician Frege - that the meaning of a phrase can be determined from the meanings of its parts and how those parts are combined - logicians have developed formal accounts of how the meaning of a sentence can be determined from the relations of words in a sentence. This idea culminated famously in Linguistics in the work of Richard Montague in the 1970s. The compositional approach addresses a fundamental problem in Linguistics - how it is that humans are able to generate an unlimited number of sentences using a limited vocabulary. We would like computers to have a similar capacity also.
</p>
<p> The second, more recent, approach to modelling meaning in NLP focuses on the meanings of the words themselves. This is the so-called distributional approach to modelling word meanings and is based on the ideas of the "structural" linguists such as Firth from the 1950s. This idea is also sometimes related to Wittenstein's philosophy of "meaning as use". The idea is that the meanings of words can be determined by considering the contexts in which words appear in text. For example, if we take a large amount of text and see which words appear close to the word "dog", and do a similar thing for the word "cat", we will see that the contexts of dog and cat tend to share many words in common (such as walk, run, furry, pet, and so on). Whereas if we see which words appear in the context of the word "television", for example, we will find less overlap with the contexts for "dog". Mathematically we represent the contexts in a vector space, so that word meanings occupy positions in a geometrical space. We would expect to find that "dog" and "cat" are much closer in the space than "dog" and "television", indicating that "dog" and "cat" are closer in meaning than "dog" and "television". </p>
<p>The two approaches to meaning can be roughly characterized as follows: the compositional approach is concerned with how meanings combine, but has little to say about the individual meanings of words; the distributional approach is concerned with word meanings, but has little to say about how those meanings combine. This project exploits the strengths of the two approaches, by developing a unified model of distributional and compositional semantics. The project has a central theoretical component, drawing on models of semantics from Theoretical Computer Science and Mathematical Logic. This central component which will inform, be driven by, and evaluated on tasks and applications in NLP and Information Retrieval,and also data drawn from empirical studies in Cognitive Science (the computational study of the mind). Hence we aim to make the following contributions:
 <ul>
 	<li> advance the theoretical study of meaning in Linguistics, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence;
	<li> develop new meaning-sensitive approaches to NLP applications which can be robustly applied to naturally occurring text.
 	
 </ul>

<h4>In the Hands of the Analyst: Unlocking the value of social media for professional market research</h4>
<p>The objective of this project is to unlock the full attitudinal value of the new datasets created by the explosion of social media use. To do this, the project will build the first integrated system – both technology and method – that allows these new datasets to be analyzed in a way that reflects the values and principles of conventional attitudinal research. This will allow very large amounts of new data to be credibly analyzed to produce trustworthy insight capable of informing important decisions across both the private and public sector. The project aims to apply this new capability as the first „full service‟ solution that connects social media with other social data, social media research with social science, and commercialize it as a range of market-differentiated products representing a transformative step forwards in the sector.</p>
<p> This is a joint research project with Ipsos MORI, Demos, and CASM Consulting LLP., and is jointly funded by the Technology Strategy Board, the ESRC, the EPSRC and DSTL under the Data exploration - creating new insight and value - Collaborative R&D competition.</p>

<h4>Near You Now</h4>
<p>
The Near You Now Demonstrator will enable customers to access hyperlocal media stories from a range of publishers on mobile devices based on relevance at their precise location. Publishers, large and small, will have the opportunity to syndicate content and share revenue. This new collaborative ecosystem will result in more relevant local media services for end customers, deeper engagement and monetisation opportunities for large regional publishers and a more sustainable future for hundreds of smaller independent hyperlocal media producers across the UK. </p>
<p>
	This is a joint research project with Near You Now Ltd, rchant Community Media Ltd, London Belongs to Me Ltd (KentishTowner) and Streetbook Ltd (Streetlife.com), and is funded by the Technology Strategy Board under the Destination Local demonstrators competition.
